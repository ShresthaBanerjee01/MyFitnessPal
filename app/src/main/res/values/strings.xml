    <string name="boat_pose"><b>Step 1.</b> Take a seat. Sit on your mat with your knees bent and your feet flat on the floor.\n\n<b>Step 2.</b> Lift and balance. Lean back, slightly rolling your lower back so that your tailbone tucks under without making direct contact with the ground.Use this leverage to lift your legs off the floor while your buttocks help maintain balance.You can also place your hands behind the outside of your knees to help stabilize your form.\n\n<b>Step 3.</b> Stretch and lengthen. While balancing on your sit bones, extend your legs out in front of you, slowly raising them into the air while you flatten your spine and lift your sternum towards the ceiling. Your body should form a V-shape at a 45-degree angle, with your sitting bones as the point of contact with the ground. Spread your shoulder blades wide and place your hands on the outside of your knees so your arms are parallel to the floor.\n\n<b>Step 4.</b> Hold and release. Keep your breathing steady and your gaze fixed on your big toes. Hold this pose for up to one minute.
